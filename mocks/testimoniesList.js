    content: `<p>I thank God for the power in His word and for the work of the Holy Spirit in making men believe His word. I am ever grateful to God for looking down in mercy to save my soul while in secondary school. I had two distinct experiences on how God speaks while I was a teenager –one in the hospital while being treated for a broken leg after a car accident, and the other on my way home from an errand, when God spoke using an outdoor film show on the restitution of Zacchaeus. These experiences were my earliest memories of the fact that God speaks and these built in me an endless personal relationship with Him.</p>

    <p>There have been many things I have had to wait on God for – what school to attend; what course to study; career switch from Telecommunications to Consulting etc., but none of these was as breath-taking as waiting on Him on the subject of who and when to marry. One thing worked for me and it is that I never wanted anything outside of God’s will and He always saw that I was desperate to have His will done. So, I prayed until I was emptied of self and had sweet peace. This has been my long route of knowing God’s will – emptying self, finding sweet peace and then taking the decision.</p>
    
    <p>I had been blessed with so many great friends at various stages of my life, but I had not always considered marriage with any, because of a personal belief that a relationship will only be considered when I have an established long-term vision and direction for my life. I had attempted crossing the line of my personal belief sometimes, and I regret I ever did. That long-term vision was neither established after NYSC, nor upon qualification as a Chartered Accountant, nor in my two years of working with a telecommunications giant. However, a desire to gain international financial reporting skills prompted a long-term career move to consulting. It was within this move that God saw the need for a ‘helpmate’ and that was the first thing God did on my first morning in Deloitte, unknown to me.</p>
    I did not have to bring many of my friends before God to ask “who?”; though I had one on my mind that shared faith and communications with me. However, since my way of knowing God’s will was a long route, it took me months to know it was not her and in fact, she was to get married a few months before me.</p>
    
    <p>With the highest-ranked friend amongst my peers out of the way, I began to notice the diligence and meticulousness of my wife, who at that time had been working with me in church for about a year. I began to like her and had to let it pass through the long route of knowing God’s will. As each day passed, I loved her the more, but I had not yet gotten a response. I was not having time to consecrate and pray due to work pressure, frequent travels and multiple examinations. In the week of one of my exams, I had a huge burden to pray and God required me to forfeit the exams and to wait on Him as I would be returning to work thereafter. This I did and found the sweet peace I needed.</p>
    
    <p>I discussed with the marriage counselor, and he asked that I go back to seek re-assurances. So, I tarried in Anthony for two days to enable me clear that before resuming to work, and this, God honored. I had asked for signs I never got, but then God spoke to me just like he did when I was a teenager and reminded me of the first person I had communicated with, the first morning I resumed at Deloitte. I argued with God – I never had communication links to my wife, not until recently, and my phone had also been changed since I resumed at Deloitte. But then, God asked me to check my social media platform messages. I did, and observed that I had responded to her “friend request” and sent congratulatory messages on her convocation. This was a shock and joy to me, as I was in awe as to how God had led. I met the marriage counselor the same day and he asked me to inform her. We met in the evening of the same day, but I could only tell her over the phone that night as I resumed work the next day. That was the most fulfilling “leave” period I had ever had.</p>
    
    <p>My wife will have her pray through experience to share because it took her six months to respond. But, we did have a good relationship, hence I was not under pressure as to what Her response will be. When she accepted, we were advised by the DS to jointly go and seek assurances and be willing to let go, in case all the necessary boxes were not ticked. This was our interpretation of what he said and our knowledge of the books we had read and planned to read. As such, our courtship was a very cautious one as we kept on hoping it was indeed His will if He allowed it to scale through. In that period, we began to keep a diary of assurances on almost all matters for the future and had lots of good time to know each other.</p>
    
    <p>In the month before our wedding, the devil hit me with loads of doubts to the point that I had called off the wedding in my mind; this I saw as being willing to let go. But, as I approached the office where I intended to seek counsel, the spirit of God came and gave me more than enough flashbacks of assurances that outweighed the doubts. With this final check, I committed to God and my wife on October 16, 2014, and since then God has kept His every word.</p>`,

    content: `<p>I thank God for the opportunity to be born and raised in a Christian home where our parents taught us the way of the Lord. However, in my late-teens, I felt my upbringing was strict and not interesting so, I sought to go the way of the world.</p>

    <p>At 17, I was on my way to the university and it was there that the devil really got hold of me; I mixed with the wrong crowd and it was a downward slope from there. I partied, smoked, took alcohol and sampled drugs. At some point I stopped coming home regularly for holidays. Despite all of that, I knew I had parents that were praying for me because on several occasions I was delivered from death while still in my sinful ways.</p>
    
    <p>The words of an old hymn says “sin will cost you than you want to pay”, sin did cost me my education. I was kicked out of the university in my final year after wasting my parent’s money and my time. I was not doing well academically and had joined a gang in the university. After that, I did not know what to do. I could not come back home to tell my parents what had happened at school. I ran away from home and I thought I could figure out life by myself but it did not take long before I realized I could not go too far without God.</p>
    
    <p>The mercy of God called out to me once more. This time, it was at a place far away from home and church. I remember whispering a prayer to God out of desperation saying if He could help me get my life together, I would give Him a chance and God was faithful. In a small room where I was by myself, I knelt down, and Heaven came down, and glory filled my soul because God wonderfully saved me.</p>
    
    <p>I would never forget the year 2009 because it was the year everything became new for me and my life has not been the same since then. God later sanctified me and filled me with His Spirit. God gave me another opportunity to go back to the university and within a short time, He saw me through. Almost immediately I finished my bachelor’s degree, God gave me an opportunity to go to the UK for my Master’s degree and over there, He not only saw me through my academics, He was with me.</p>
    
    <p>After my Master’s degree, God opened a way for me to move to Canada where I settled and over there, He provided for me a young Christian lady in this church as a wife and He has blessed us with two wonderful boys.</p>
    
    <p>wonderful boys. Oh how I just love the Lord! My desire now is to be in His service and to be around God’s children. I know one day I would see Him face to face and I would be able to praise Him evermore. I praise God for His mercies!</p>`,

    content: `<p>I was born into a Christian home but I was not a Christian. I was struggling with an evil anger without help, but when I surrendered my life to God, He transformed my life. While growing up, we were always admonished to commit our future marital lives into God's hands so that He will perfect our ways. I did this and God answered my prayer 15 years before He showed me the actual person. God made a covenant with me and gave me promises and some distinct attributes and specifications concerning the wife He will bless me with.</p>

    <p>I used to be a very anxious and impatient person. When it seemed the manifestation of God's promise to me was taking longer than expected, I tried in my own ways to work it out, but God in His mercy scolded me back to His pathway. One day, after my National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), while walking down towards the Anthony Village campground cabins, a lady passed by and God told me ‘that is your wife.’ The devil was not happy about this. He raised up some people to spread false information about my fertility. It took another 3 years of serious prayers to confirm that she is my wife.</p>
    
    <p>Glory be to God. 15 years after God promised me a good wife, He married for me in the Gospel and a month into our marriage, my wife conceived and today God has blessed my family with 2 children. Our God is faithful to His promises</p>`,

    content: `<p>I want to use this opportunity to testify to the power of Jesus Christ to save a man from his life of sin. Though I was born into this glorious gospel, I couldn’t access the true riches of God because I lived in sin. No doubt, growing up, I enjoyed divine protection, healing, and provision as part of the grace God showed my parents but I didn’t seek to have a personal relationship with God.</p>

    <p>Some years back, while I was studying overseas, I ran into serious difficulties. Since I didn’t know any other method of accessing divine help, I decided to go on my knees to seek for salvation and Jesus saved me. Thereafter, Jesus Christ resolved the problem in a miraculous way but I got comfortable and drifted back into sin. After my studies, I returned to the country to seek for job. When my efforts were abortive, I sought God’s help, and He saved me and gave me two jobs to pick from. Once again, I drifted gradually back into sin and got lost completely. All the while, I attended church regularly but went about my life in a carefree manner.</p>
    
    <p>Sometime in October 2015, I wanted something I considered really important to me. I believed once I got it, my financial future would be secured. A friend and I were asked to submit an application and I even arranged the documents for both of us. As God would have his way, He turned my smartness to foolishness and I made a very simple but fundamental error in my document. This made me lose out while my friend was successful. I realised at that point that God was interested in me, and my understanding of Him was that He wouldn’t stop until He got my attention. The desire to return to the cross began building inside me; this was my state of mind till January 2016.</p>
    
    <p>On the 3rd of January which happened to be the first Sunday of the year, the District Superintendent admonished us during a Sunday school review to hand over the control of our lives to Jesus Christ and He assured us that there will be no cause for regrets. I was tired of trying to do things on my own so I went down on my knees when the altar call was made. Jesus Christ saved me within few minutes of praying before the start of the devotional service. The feeling was so wonderful and the joy of heaven flooded my heart. In the evening, I told my wife that Jesus Christ saved me and she congratulated me and went inside. She came back after a while to say that Jesus had saved her too. I asked her in the middle of our rejoicing if she got jealous of me, but she told me that the desire to operate on the same spiritual level with me drove her to seek for salvation.</p>
    
    <p>Jesus Christ sanctified me in my room during the early hours of Monday, 4th of January 2016 and immediately, he compelled me to do some restitutions. One of them was particularly difficult; the devil had caused me to procrastinate for so long but God gave me the courage to go ahead and get it done. I prayed and proceeded to the house of the person involved in the morning of the 9th of January 2016. While I waited, I continued to pray in my heart for total victory and God told me He had reduced my sentence on the matter to just waiting and I believed. I waited for a couple of hours before I could meet the person involved but when I met Him, it was total victory. God went before me and I left there a joyful man.</p>
    
    <p>On Sunday, 10th of January 2016, I woke up very early with the mind of going for the combined service to seek for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but God had a better plan. I knelt down to pray by my bedside and God told me to seek for it right there, that He was ready to endue me with the power for service. I prayed and the Holy Spirit came down in a mighty way. I had never felt that way before in my entire life. Jesus baptised me with the Holy Spirit. Glory be to His name! That Sunday, when I got to church, before the start of the service, I prayed that Jesus should break the evil covenant of generational pride in my family and He did it. After the service, I prayed to be endowed with the spirit of humility and Jesus did it for me.</p>
    
    <p>The change in my life was noticeable in the office that one of my supervisors told another colleague that something had happened to Gbenga. Someone else said He would like to know the pastor who changed me. It wasn’t a pastor. Jesus did it.
    Jesus Christ has placed a burden in my heart to tell others who are born in the gospel like myself but have gone astray, to return quickly to Jesus because His coming is very near and He wants the joy of our parents, dead or alive to be full in heaven. I am a babe in Christ and I wish to grow quickly in Him. Please people of God, assist me in praying that God should keep me firm till I will see Him in glory.</p>

    <p>I thank God for everything, especially for saving my soul and for keeping me in the gospel.
    I wasn't born in the gospel, but I thank God for making me find the gospel, may His name be praised (Amen). </p>
    
    <p>I also want to thank God for what he did for me during the 2019 International Youth Camp. God really surprised me to the point that whenever I sit back and think about it, I always find myself saying - thank you Jesus. God really favored me – using someone who I don’t even know till today, to bless me, and for this I am grateful to God. God (through this unknown person) gave me a sum of five hundred thousand naira, for me to use it to start my fashion and design business. God is Great! I have now gotten a shop, machines and other things that will make my business a success and by God's grace the business is prospering. </p>
    
    
    <p>I really thank God and always ask Him to bless my sponsor and everyone that contributed to my success.
    Please pray for me to see HIM face to face.... thanks</p>

    <p>But later on, while growing up and struggling with fear of missing the rapture and worldly affections, I settled to find a genuine salvation that really worked. After rising and falling several times, God gave me the True Salvation.</p>
    
    <p>I thank God because he always reminded me if what he wants me to be for him compared to what I am now. That is what pushed me to get saved and also what has helped me to remain saved so far.</p>
    
    <p>There have been a lot of distractions and some mistakes, but I thank God he always puts me in check. Sometimes I don’t feel comfortable and when I pray, I realize that what made me feel uneasy was something I did against God’s will but thought it didn’t really matter.</p>
    
    
      <p>God has helped me in school with this. And as I grow in grace, he has made it easier for me to know his will and be able to caution myself when I’m going beyond the limits and standards of a Christian.</p>

    <p>It's quite a privilege for me to be given this opportunity to share my testimony to other teens like me. I wouldn't want to mince words; I was born in this glorious gospel and I understood the tenets of the gospel by virtue of Sunday school lessons and other Bible teachings but that didn't make me godly but I was goodly as I knew the things to do and not to do, but it all changed when I prayed genuinely for the salvation of my soul; I prayed and Jesus saved my soul, it was a night that's still evergreen in my memory, I felt light and different and I couldn't do things I'd ordinarily do.</p>
     <p>In 2018, I was informed by youth leaders in my zone that I'd represent the zone in a Bible quiz; prior to that I had not done any but I liked Bible quizzes. I prepared casually but when I won at the district level, I realised that I'll have to prepare seriously. I won at the regional level and it dawned on me that I'd be representing the region at WeCA, I was kinda afraid but I didn't let that get into my head, I read the necessary places and I prayed so with that I was a bit confident and I went into the finals with the same confidence and the rest is history.</p>
    <p>And since then I've had the chance to fulfill my desire to work for God in the music department; today I'm a Junior choir and I'm not stopping there.</p>
     <p>My big testimony is how I got my admission. I had written JAMB and  WAEC exams and I had a good score and grades so I was confident I'd make it into the university and I also prayed to God that I didn't want to write any external examination twice. Admission lists began to come out and my own status was still "not admitted" I was shocked, I continued to pray even with that nothing happened and I was telling God even those with lower marks were getting admitted so what's wrong with me. I took a step of faith, I wrote a petition to the JAMB registrar who in turn wrote to my school registrar to get me admitted and on my birthday I was admitted into the university and today, I'm a 2nd year student of AAUA studying Law. It shows God answers prayers and this is my testimony.</p>`,

Later, during a children's programme we staged in the church, the WORD spoke to me and conviction gripped me. The WORD was so powerful that it swept me off my feet. I prayed hard and by God's grace, I was filled with His light.</p>
    <p>During this pandemic, I  heard about a competition titled 'The pilgrims progress'. At first, I was skeptical about it but later I decided to participate in it. When Maaye and I were chosen to represent our region, challenges came. </p>
    <p> A week before the competition I was very sick, I mistakenly inhaled an acidic gas which blocked my lungs and made it difficult for me to breathe, I thought I was going to die. My family and I prayed hard, my teacher, sister Nike also prayed for me and glory be to God because he took control. It took almost 6 hours for me to be able to breathe normally again. I thank God for that.</p>
    <p>Another challenge was about my exams, I was to have a practical exam on the supposed day of the competition. All hope was lost when WECA advised our leaders to replace me with another person. I had totally released the position and accepted my fate. On the eve of the D day, I was restless, a Voice told me to pray and prepare for the competition, I did as I was advised and to my surprised on the D day, the paper arrived earlier than expected, I finished the paper before the time of the competition and was able to participate fully in the competition.</p>
    <p>The competition was controlled by the Lord God Almighty, may all glory honor and adoration be to His holy name. Amen. Brethren, please pray for me to meet this wonderful Savior at the end of my journey in this world.</p>`,

    <p>I thank God because he answers prayers. After graduation,  I told God to do my posting. When the posting came out, I saw Akwa Ibom, “haa”, from one extreme of the country to another. I was shocked but couldn't do anything because I had asked for God's will, so I accepted it like that. Obedience pays. It was announced then, that all intending Corps Members should send their details to YDD at WECA, that I did and was happy I did.</p>
    <p>I always tell people, especially the youths that there is love in the gospel and Jesus has made us one big family despite all odds. After my posting, my former pastor insisted I should live with his family - that was free accommodation. AFCMF is wonderful; a wing of the church that brings Corps Members to fellowship together. In the orientation camp, we were able to fellowship twice a week.</p>
    <p>The Uyo district headquarters compiled our details and forwarded to a church member who is an NYSC Staff. All of us then, including those who were non-Apostolic Faith member (because they joined our fellowship) were posted to where we wanted and about 80% of us posted to the capital city. It pays to serve Jesus. We were conveyed to the church by the church bus after orientation camp and fed sumptuously.</p>
    <p>It is good to be in the midst of the people of God, because one feels at home. With the help of AFCMF (WECA and Ikot Enwang Region), we were able to hold programs, rally and prayer retreat for the Corps Members and the youths.  When I passed out with my colleagues the church organized send forth for us which we didn't even expect. I, in particular, was honoured with another special send forth and various presents by the choristers, which made me feel highly elated. </p>
    <p>I must say, there were trials and temptations, but the God I know and His graces embedded in me saw me through the service year. Glory be to God because I can now look back and say it was God all through.</p>

    content: `<p>I thank God for the privilege of being born into the gospel. It's one of the many blessings I have as a young person. When I was still a teenager, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior and since then, Jesus has been my friend.  </p>
    <p>In 2019 I was posted to Kwara state for the compulsory Nationalonal Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Although, that wasn't my state of choice, but I wasn't moved to apply for redeployment. Over eleven months, God kept me. </p>
    <p>I'm grateful that I constantly enjoy God's protection. One morning, while going on an official assignment with my employer, we were involved in an accident. For a moment, my heart skipped and all I could say was "The blood of Jesus." Thankfully, God saw us through unharmed, though we sustained very minor injuries.</p>
    <p>At a point, all my colleagues mentioned they had killed scorpions in their rooms. Before this, I'd never seen a scorpion. One evening, while sitting outside with my flatmate, I had no idea that right beside me was a scorpion. My flatmate had gone inside to pick something and on coming out, she sighted it and motioned on me to stand up. I can't tell how long the scorpion had been there; so close to me, but I can tell that only God had protected me from being stung.  </p>
    <p>I'm happy to be associated with Jesus. It's my earnest prayer that God would continue to keep me in His grace till eternity calls.</p>

    content: `<p>Glory be to God, I want to thank God, for his power to protect, may his name be glorified. I am a student of The Lagos State University and I want to thank God because he saved me from being pierced by stray bullets. It happened one day after lectures, on my way to the hostel. I moved freely from the gate closer to my hostel from school, but by the time I got to the market place close to my hostel, I started hearing people behind me take to their heels, they were running and soon I heard gunshots and then I determined to run forward, but the spirit God came to me, that why don't I just run to a nearby shop and hide. Immediately, I obeyed and soon some people joined me, we were there for close to twenty minutes, then a brother who was there with us advised that, those going towards the shooting point should stay back, while those going away should move on. At first, I was reluctant to do so, but later I proceeded in faith and God gave me the victory. I thank God because he has taken charge of things there now, that no one would ever believe that such thing did happen there, I give God the glory. Please pray with me that God who has kept me thus far, should see me through my stay in the school, I praise the Lord.</p>

    God provided me admission into university with no bribe nor manipulation of results and He cares for me in term of provisions and protection ability to read and assimilate, He always helping me in all my examinations without being involved in exam malpractice
    Our God never fails</p>
    <p>During my second semester examination in 200level as Afcf member we use to have a combined prayer before our examination start, after this prayer devil rose to tempt the power of God but he failed woefully, there was a course that combined all Education students but based on department,  it was unfortunately clashing with one of my departmental courses so it was shifted to the following week while other departments did theirs with ID card, I went to exam hall in the day scheduled with my ID card, on getting to the exam hall the lecturer in charge said anybody without pass card would not be allowed to write the exam i.e the course would be automatically carried over. It was like a joke when 1hr:30minutes exam of 50 fill in the gap with 2 essays left with 30minutes
    
    From the exam hall to the faculty where the pass can be received is 20 minutes trekking tho and fro. Glory be to Jesus! On my way going God provided me free bus tho and fro I got my exam pass in replacement of my ID card at the faculty on getting to exam hall it was 20minutes to the end of the paper, Satan was roaring like lion but my God is a Great God, Lion of Judah in me gave me confidence above every spirit of carry over. The lecturer said to me "no extra time but you can now start" I started and I submitted at the same time with my fellow students.
    
    On getting to the Hod's office for my I'd card after I had paid for the pass my ID card could not be found, meanwhile ID card was only recognized to write exam in my department "No ID card no Exam" Automatic carry over again, our God have been faithful to His children on campus, I went on mine knees to meet God on my private altar he answered "I declared found" on Friday before my exam I went there on getting there the man was searching for my ID card I moved forward to check it myself suddenly a lady came in, a 400level student, she came for collection of ID card the officer in charge of ID card poured it down behold I saw my ID card in the midst of 400level students ID card!
    
    Jesus surprised me in all this examinations. When the results came out, He blessed me with good grades beyond my imaginations. </p>
    
    <p>I rendered my life unto God. </p>
