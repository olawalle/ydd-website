    content: `There have been many things I have had to wait on God for – what school to attend; what course to study; career switch from Telecommunications to Consulting etc., but none of these was as breath-taking as waiting on Him on the subject of who and when to marry. One thing worked for me and it is that I never wanted anything outside of God’s will and He always saw that I was desperate to have His will done. So, I prayed until I was emptied of self and had sweet peace. This has been my long route of knowing God’s will – emptying self, finding sweet peace and then taking the decision.`,

    content: `Let’s settle one issue right away. God means exactly what He says. Now before you throw your hands in the air and walk off in hopeless frustration, listen to this: God is not a tyrant; He is not commanding something that He knows is impossible for us to do, nor is He unaware of what you and I face in this wicked world. Yet He still requires the true Christian to be holy.`,
