Now before you throw your hands in the air and walk off in hopeless frustration, listen to this: God is not a tyrant; He is not commanding something that He knows is impossible for us to do, nor is He unaware of what you and I face in this wicked world. Yet He still requires the true Christian to be holy`,

    content: `Why is it so hard for us to find God’s will for our lives? The answer is simple. Our own will gets in the way. Yes, there are other possible hindrances, and we will discuss some of them here, but the will is the central problem. If we want to be certain we are following God’s plan and not our own, we must make sure our will is fully submitted to His.`,

    content: `Don’t just accept someone else’s idea! Exercise your own will! Be Independent and think for yourself! Have you ever heard that philosophy expressed? in Rd it's the fashion not to worry about doctrines and persuasions that been taught to us. If we have a religious belief, we may be told that we were bent that way by our upbringing. Standing for a believe rightly placed in God almighty is not a sign of being a weakling. It is a sign of strength to stick by your faith and to say, “I want to do what I ought to do.” If you have the position, stay with it.`,

He introduced the Young Couples Forum and explained the topic “IT TAKES TWO” where he talked about how important it is for Husband and Wife to work together in Partnership to make their marriage a success. He also identified some key advantages of couples working together from Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. Some of these are - They have good reward for their labour, to prevent one another from falling, to keep warm and to have victory over the enemy in partnership.
  
          The virtual program had two guest couples connected from their respective locations, to give their various experiences and perspectives as regards the topic. The two couples, are Brother and Sister Lucky Ishomo, Brother and Sister Oladehinde.
          Brother Tosin shobukola, who moderated the event, started with a memory verse taken from the book of Ecclesiastes 4:9.
          
          Brother Tunde Oladehinde who spoke first, talked about the different but complimentary role that God gave Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, and mentioned how important it is for every couple to understand that marriage as ordained by God, is a joint responsibility and failure to follow the precepts as God has laid it down will result in problems for the couples. Sister Blessing, who subsequently affirmed what brother Tunde had said, added that God had made the man the head of the house, and the duty of the woman, whom God made a helpmeet, is to provide the necessary support needed for the man to fulfill his purpose for which God has chosen him.
          Adding clarity to that, she stressed that God said women should submit to their own husband, and not another person’s husband, women are to complement their husband and not to compete with their husband. She further added that men ought to also study their wives, to be able to get the best out of them.
          
          Brother Lucky highlighted the important steps required to making the home what God wants it to be, he emphasized the need for the three Christian experiences in every Christian home its importance to ensure that the husband and wife work together in one accord.
          Brother Tosin the moderator, classified the responsibilities in the home into 4 different categories:
          
          Spiritual Responsibility
          Emotional Responsibility
          Parental Responsibility
          Financial Responsibility
          
          Sister Opaleye, who was also present with her husband, explained while answering one of the questions asked by the audience, the need for couples to avoid dwelling on each other’s past mistakes, to avoid unnecessary anger or misunderstanding.
          Rev Moh, who was also in attendance with his wife, explained the effort the church is making, to ensure that marriage counseling and support are made available and accessible to everyone, even at the branch level.
          Several Questions from the audience followed the session which was carefully treated by the Guest speakers. Sis. Moh, stress the need for every couple to be careful in taking the issues in their marriage to other people for advice. She further advised that both partners should ensure that they create time and attention for themselves, and their marriage
          
          The program came to an end, as the winners of the couple’s challenge that preceded the couple’s forum were announced.
          A song was rendered by Bro Banji, after which the DS gave the closing charge.
          The DS reading from Psalm 133: 1-3, emphasized on why it is important that a home or marriage is not only built on God’s direction but also maintained and nurtured by the precepts and process God has instructed. He further mentioned that the church’s interest and desire are to see that marriages don’t only work out well, but also in unity, hence the reason for organizing such a program.
          He stressed, that a home can only function perfectly and peacefully if both parties allow the holy spirit to come in and direct the affairs of the home. Reading from Zachariah 4 vs 6, he narrated the strength of a home that was built on the rock, and a home built on God’s words and injunctions, and when the storm of life comes, the home will surely stand because it was built on God’s foundation.
          Lastly, he advised every couple to let the Holy Spirit into their home and their affairs, as he ended the program with a closing prayer.`,

    content: `The online programme - a novel one, which was broadcasted on our social media channels, lasted for 2hrs. 15mins, the session started with songs from the CGS, 14, 612, was followed by an opening prayer by the WECA Youth Leader, Brother Tobi Popogbe, who proceeded to give the announcements. He introduced the Young Couples Forum and explained the topic “IT TAKES TWO” where he talked about how important it is for Husband and Wife to work together in Partnership to make their marriage a success. He also identified some key advantages of couples working together from Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. Some of these are - They have good reward for their labour, to prevent one another from falling, to keep warm and to have victory over the enemy in partnership.
  
          The virtual program had two guest couples connected from their respective locations, to give their various experiences and perspectives as regards the topic. The two couples, are Brother and Sister Lucky Ishomo, Brother and Sister Oladehinde.
          Brother Tosin shobukola, who moderated the event, started with a memory verse taken from the book of Ecclesiastes 4:9.
          
          Brother Tunde Oladehinde who spoke first, talked about the different but complimentary role that God gave Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, and mentioned how important it is for every couple to understand that marriage as ordained by God, is a joint responsibility and failure to follow the precepts as God has laid it down will result in problems for the couples. Sister Blessing, who subsequently affirmed what brother Tunde had said, added that God had made the man the head of the house, and the duty of the woman, whom God made a helpmeet, is to provide the necessary support needed for the man to fulfill his purpose for which God has chosen him.
          Adding clarity to that, she stressed that God said women should submit to their own husband, and not another person’s husband, women are to complement their husband and not to compete with their husband. She further added that men ought to also study their wives, to be able to get the best out of them.
