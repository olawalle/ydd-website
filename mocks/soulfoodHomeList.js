Now before you throw your hands in the air and walk off in hopeless frustration, listen to this: God is not a tyrant; He is not commanding something that He knows is impossible for us to do, nor is He unaware of what you and I face in this wicked world. Yet He still requires the true Christian to be holy.`,

      content: `Why is it so hard for us to find God’s will for our lives? The answer is simple. Our own will gets in the way. Yes, there are other possible hindrances, and we will discuss some of them here, but the will is the central problem. If we want to be certain we are following God’s plan and not our own, we must make sure our will is fully submitted to His.`,

Have you ever heard that philosophy expressed? in Rd it's the fashion not to worry about doctrines and persuasions that been taught to us. If we have a religious belief, we may be told that we were bent that way by our upbringing. Standing for a believe rightly placed in God almighty is not a sign of being a weakling. It is a sign of strength to stick by your faith and to say, “I want to do what I ought to do.” If you have the position, stay with it.`,
