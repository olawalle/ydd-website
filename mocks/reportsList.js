    content: `The online programme - a novel one, which was broadcasted on our social media channels, lasted for 2hrs. 15mins, the session started with songs from the CGS, 14, 612, was followed by an opening prayer by the WECA Youth Leader, Brother Tobi Popogbe, who proceeded to give the announcements. He introduced the Young Couples Forum and explained the topic “IT TAKES TWO” where he talked about how important it is for Husband and Wife to work together in Partnership to make their marriage a success. He also identified some key advantages of couples working together from Ecclesiastes 4:9-12. Some of these are - They have good reward for their labour, to prevent one another from falling, to keep warm and to have victory over the enemy in partnership.

        The virtual program had two guest couples connected from their respective locations, to give their various experiences and perspectives as regards the topic. The two couples, are Brother and Sister Lucky Ishomo, Brother and Sister Oladehinde.
        Brother Tosin shobukola, who moderated the event, started with a memory verse taken from the book of Ecclesiastes 4:9.
        
        Brother Tunde Oladehinde who spoke first, talked about the different but complimentary role that God gave Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, and mentioned how important it is for every couple to understand that marriage as ordained by God, is a joint responsibility and failure to follow the precepts as God has laid it down will result in problems for the couples. Sister Blessing, who subsequently affirmed what brother Tunde had said, added that God had made the man the head of the house, and the duty of the woman, whom God made a helpmeet, is to provide the necessary support needed for the man to fulfill his purpose for which God has chosen him.
        Adding clarity to that, she stressed that God said women should submit to their own husband, and not another person’s husband, women are to complement their husband and not to compete with their husband. She further added that men ought to also study their wives, to be able to get the best out of them.
        
        Brother Lucky highlighted the important steps required to making the home what God wants it to be, he emphasized the need for the three Christian experiences in every Christian home its importance to ensure that the husband and wife work together in one accord.
        Brother Tosin the moderator, classified the responsibilities in the home into 4 different categories:
        
        Spiritual Responsibility
        Emotional Responsibility
        Parental Responsibility
        Financial Responsibility
        
        Sister Opaleye, who was also present with her husband, explained while answering one of the questions asked by the audience, the need for couples to avoid dwelling on each other’s past mistakes, to avoid unnecessary anger or misunderstanding.
        Rev Moh, who was also in attendance with his wife, explained the effort the church is making, to ensure that marriage counseling and support are made available and accessible to everyone, even at the branch level.
        Several Questions from the audience followed the session which was carefully treated by the Guest speakers. Sis. Moh, stress the need for every couple to be careful in taking the issues in their marriage to other people for advice. She further advised that both partners should ensure that they create time and attention for themselves, and their marriage
        
        The program came to an end, as the winners of the couple’s challenge that preceded the couple’s forum were announced.
        A song was rendered by Bro Banji, after which the DS gave the closing charge.
        The DS reading from Psalm 133: 1-3, emphasized on why it is important that a home or marriage is not only built on God’s direction but also maintained and nurtured by the precepts and process God has instructed. He further mentioned that the church’s interest and desire are to see that marriages don’t only work out well, but also in unity, hence the reason for organizing such a program.
        He stressed, that a home can only function perfectly and peacefully if both parties allow the holy spirit to come in and direct the affairs of the home. Reading from Zachariah 4 vs 6, he narrated the strength of a home that was built on the rock, and a home built on God’s words and injunctions, and when the storm of life comes, the home will surely stand because it was built on God’s foundation.
        Lastly, he advised every couple to let the Holy Spirit into their home and their affairs, as he ended the program with a closing prayer.`,

    content: `ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION
    Except for Oyo and Osun Districts, all other regions safely arrived on Friday. The secretariat was responsible for registration, allocation of accommodation and distribution of conference materials.
    
    WELCOME PROGRAMME
    At 6:00 pm, delegates converged in the tabernacle. The programme commenced with a soul-lifting prayer room service led by Bro. Segun Sonowo, the Lagos Regional Youth Head.
    
    The main activities for the programme started with renditions from the choir after which the congregation led by Brother Banji Tai-Sonubi sang. This was followed by an opening prayer by Bro. Paul Olofa.
    
    Rev. Mabel Odunsi, the Director of Youths, gave the welcome address. Rev. Funso Sobowale, the Ado-Ekiti Regional Overseer, Rev. Umarudeen Olowosile, the Ondo District Overseer, Brother Olamide Omojola, the Rep. of the Ado-Ekiti Regional Youth Head and Brother Abraham Popogbe, the WECA Youth Leader were also present.
    
    The welcome charge was given by Rev. Umarudeen Olowosile, who expressed his excitement to host the 2020 YLCB. Reading from Jer. 51:21-23, he assured leaders that, “God has brought us here as His battle-axe to be processed for the battle head, which has already been won by God Himself”. He encouraged the leaders to rededicate themselves for a fresh experience, urging them to ignore their inabilities and focus on God who is willing and ready to do exceedingly abundant things through them. This was followed by a prayer session.
    
    A female quartet sang “Saved for a Witness” before the Article Review on “The Call to Witness” was taken by Brother Itoro Etim, Uyo District HOD Secretariat. The reviewer explained that God brought the leaders together for a spiritual rebranding and wants to use the YLCB to “Shapen and Sharpen us”. He further reminded leaders of the three pillars of witnessing as contained in Acts 2:1-2, challenging them to take Witnessing (soul-winning) as a target-driven responsibility. Delegates were moved to pray after the review.
    
    Bro. Banji Tai-Sonubi led delegates in singing the theme song, “A Soul-winner for Jesus”. Shortly after, Brother Abraham Popogbe reminded the leaders of the YDD Standard Operating Procedures, emphasising the need for all leaders to work towards achieving the vision of YDD.
    The session was ended with a prayer offered by Brother Abraham MiponJesu 
    
    
    DAY 2 (SATURDAY, 14TH MARCH, 2020)
    The day started with a morning prayer session which lasted 90 minutes. The spirit of God descended in its mighty power and filled the room. Delegates did not only pray down the power of God to witness, but it was also a time for self-searching, rebranding, rededication and reconnection with the source of power and fire. It was indeed the "Upper Room Experience".
    
    
    FAITH CLINIC
    The session kick-started after an organ prelude which was followed by congregational singing led by Brother Olamide Omojola, after which, Bro. Alban Igwe, our guest facilitator, gave the opening prayer.
    A duet rendition, "Let me Touch Him" preceded the Faith Clinic titled "Living Witnesses" which was anchored by Rev. Funso Sobowale, the Ado-Ekiti Regional Overseer. Scriptural references which were taken from Luke 24:45; Ezekiel 22:30; 1 Cor. 9:16; Acts 26:19; Daniel 12:3 amongst others, covered a wide range of aspects of living as witnesses for Jesus. Rev. Funso emphasised the importance of being sure of one's experiences before setting out to witness because "you can only give what you have". He stressed that the world is more interested in seeing Christians live what they preach.
    
    Delegates were also reminded of various ways of witnessing and urged to live according to the mandate God has given them. He assuredly stated that every soulwinner would be rewarded in due time. However, disobedience to the mandate would attract consequences from God.
    The faith clinic was brought to an end as delegates were moved to pray intensively. 
    
    FIRST SESSION
    The choir opened this session by singing, "Go and tell the story". Afterwards, a short "Documentary on the Evangelistic Strides of the Church and Campus AVS" was played. The documentary was a visual presentation of the results of effective witnessing of the veterans which consequently led to the establishment of The Apostolic Faith Church in Nigeria and its rapid spread across other countries in Africa.
    This session was anchored by Brother Kayode Salami, the Lagos Region Youth Leader.
    
    The documentary set the tone for the interactive session which followed, led by Bro Olamide Omojola, where "Evangelistic Models for this Age" was discussed. The major highlight of this session was the three important P(s) in evangelism which were identified as:
    
    Pre-evangelism (Prayer, holy living, selflessness, passion)
    Public and private evangelism (Lifestyle, workplace, offices, AVS, village evangelism)
    Post-evangelism. (Follow up, care)
    Through the discussion, delegates identified the various loopholes existing in our evangelistic mission, the reasons for these loopholes and possible solutions.
    Communicating effectively with the minds of the delegates, the facilitator stated what evangelism entails, prerequisites for evangelism, the importance of evangelism and the respective models for evangelism in this new age and generation.
    
    
    Conclusively, Brother Olamide emphasised that evangelism is a crucial task which Christians must undertake, and most especially as leaders, to do the mandatory work of evangelism so that dying sinful souls can be saved from falling into the ditch of hell.
    The session ended with a closing prayer by Sister Ebere Ogbonna, the WECA Assistant HOD Secretariat which led delegates to their knees.
    PHOTO SESSION
    There was a photography session which involved all participants. 
    
    SECOND SESSION
    The second session titled "The Blights of Effective Witnessing" started with a solo presentation of "A clean heart". The session which was facilitated by Bro. Alban Igwe highlighted the following core issues as constituting hindrances to evangelism:
    Lack of the Holy Ghost and Power
    Inability to discover opportunities for witnessing
    Lack of commitment to the mandate
    Double standard /living
    The fear of standing alone amongst others
    The facilitator advised leaders to "see every sinner as a potential saint", and therefore treat evangelism as a matter of urgency. Finally, he encouraged leaders that the rewards for evangelism are imperishable which Christians must seek after.
    
    THIRD SESSION
    This break-out session had delegates distributed into various categories based on their respective offices: Apostolic Faith Campus Fellowship (AFCF), Apostolic Faith Corps Members Fellowship (AFCMF) and Youth Department Directorate (YDD) Officials. The session was titled "Strengthening /Enhancing Witnessing Platforms". The focal point of discussion in the different groups was how to leverage and make effective use of the existing platforms of evangelism.
    The YDD officials group was anchored by Brother Niyi Oladokun, the WECA HOD Outreach. He explicitly and experientially narrated the benefits of evangelism and soul-winning. To drive home his points, he engaged the leaders in a short exercise that revealed that most youth leaders have been lagging in their evangelistic assignment. He concluded with a charge from Luke 3:9, urging every leader present to join some, if not all of the evangelism channels of the Church and the AVS.
    
    AFCF/AFCMF SYNDICATE CLASS
    AFCF and AFCMF also had their classes based on "Effective Evangelism on Campus" and "A Prayerful and an Accountable Fellowship". Brothers Onilude Tanimowo and Ayomikun Akinbobola served as facilitators in the respective classes.
    In the AFCF class, key issues regarding evangelism were discussed. Student leaders were admonished to uphold the standard of the gospel on campus, as a means of identification amongst other fellowships on campus. Asides group evangelism, students were encouraged to embark on personal evangelism in their respective departments and faculties. Finally, the facilitator addressed the menace of indecent dressing which is gradually creeping into the fellowship and advised that "every Christian student must be a reflection of the beauty of Jesus".
    
    The AFCMF class was built on the foundation of Prayer, Accountability and Impact. As one of the platforms for evangelism, AFCMF leaders were encouraged to embrace prayer as a weapon for a successful fellowship and as a fuel for unity; accountability as a means of keeping each member in check and impact as a means of positively affecting the people and community where God has strategically positioned them.
    
    FOURTH SESSION
    This session titled Unveiling Operational Strategies and Upcoming Programmes was facilitated by Brother Tosin Shobukola, the WECA HOD, Strategy and Planning. He carefully explained the organogram and organizational structure of the YDD. He urged every leader to treat their subordinates and followers with respect. He also highlighted the upcoming YDD Programmes.

    The question and answer session was very brief and precise. One of the major questions was how youth leaders can communicate effectively the plans of the YDD to their pastors. By the grace of God, Rev. Funso Sobowale provided satisfactory answers to all questions raised.
    Brother Abraham Popogbe anchored Highlight from Regions, as Regional Representatives presented and analyzed their report. Each representative also had the opportunity to state the challenges encountered in the course of programme execution.
    
    As the report session ended, it was a glorious outpouring of the spirit of God. Rev.Mabel Odunsi in her closing remarks, expressed gratitude and appreciation to the YDD and wonderful people of Akure church, for their warmth and hospitality, proven by the care, comfort, accommodation, and food provided to the guests.
    
    Indeed, just as Jesus fed the multitude spiritually and physically, we can boldly say the balance was well exemplified in the experience at the YLCB 2020, courtesy of Ondo District. To bring the programme to an end, Rev. Umarudeen Olowosile led the closing prayers.

    •	Humble yourself 
    •	Pray
    •	Seek God 
    •	Turn from your wicked ways
    The revival service took place in the evening with a sermon titled “Seeking First the Kingdom of God”. The preacher stressed the need for getting into the kingdom of God and emphasized the lot of an unrepentant sinner. He explained that the kingdom of God begins from the heart and urged everybody to get the kingdom of God in their heart as he invited them to the altar. After this, the AFCMF President, Sis Iniobong appreciated the host church branch (Ayetoro branch) for receiving and taking good care of them, she then charged the serving and the prospective corps members on acceptable practices expected from them during the service. The Regional Youth Head, Brother Taiwo Adeola addressed the Corps members and congratulated them for the success of the program and invited Sisters Aladetoyinbo and Owolabi to speak to the Corps members on acceptable dress codes for ladies. The program was brought to a close with Prayer from the Regional Youth Leader, Bro Kayode Adesanya.

Reading from Zachariah 4 vs 6, he narrated the strength of a home that was built on the rock, and a home built on God’s words and injunctions, and when the storm of life comes, the home will surely stand because it was built on God’s foundation.
