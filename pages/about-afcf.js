            Structure: AFCF has a well-built structure whereby a very deliberate
            channel of help is available to every student that identifies with
            the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Platform: AFCF provides a sustainable platform for the building of
            young minds in the way of the Lord. This is done by providing a
            great team spirit and an atmosphere for togetherness between
            students and the church.
          </li>
          <li>
            Programme: AFCF organizes weekly programmes for the total
            edification (spiritually and academically) of students in all
            campuses where the fellowship is present. The AFCF also holds two
            nation-wide programs twice every year in all her campuses. This goes
            a long way to reach out to students on the campuses and God has
            always used such programmes mightily to break the power of hell and
            deliver students from their misery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Care: The love among the brethren serve as a bedrock for the
            flourishing of this family of God. Everyone looks out for one
            another and helps when the need arises.
